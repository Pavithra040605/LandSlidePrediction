LandSlidePrediction



PROBLEM STATEMENT :

Landslides are a significant natural hazard causing severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment. Predicting landslide-prone areas based on environmental and geological data can help in early warning systems and disaster management planning.

DESCRIPTION :

This project aims to build a machine learning model (Decision Tree/Random Forest) to predict the occurrence of landslides using features such as slope, precipitation, elevation, lithology, NDVI, etc.
